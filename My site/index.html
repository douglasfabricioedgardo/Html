                <h2>why is important the cell phones?</h2>
                <p>
                  Cell phones have become a necessity for many people throughout the world. The ability to keep in touch with family, business associates,
                 and access to email are only a few of the reasons for the increasing importance of cell phones. Today's technically advanced cell phones are
                 capable of not only receiving and placing phone calls, but storing data, taking pictures, and can even be used as walkie talkies, to name just
                  a few of the available options.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When cell phones were first introduced to the public, they were bulky, expensive, and some even required a base unit that had to be transported
                     along with the phone. Good reception was a major problem and in general, early cell phones could only be used in certain locations were the
                     signal was particularly strong. As cell phone technology advanced, the difficult in using them became less of a problem. Today, cell phone 
                     reception has improved greatly due to the use of satellites and wireless services. As cell phones improved and became simple to use, the
                      importance of cell phones increased accordingly.
                      
                      Cell phones are the perfect way to stay connected with others and provide the user with a sense of security.
